Portfolio Optimization.

Currently it generates distribution of weights to be used for the calculation of optimal return/risk ratio for a combination of the set of stocks.

What needs to be added?
1. A front end to show the graph representing optimal ratio and for the user to provide the stocks, for which the optimal portfolio is to be generated.
2. An api to pull the stocks information that includes its associated risk and return over the period of 1 year or more. If there are not good services 
available to give the data, plan will swtich to calculate it ourselves using the historical data that is available online.

More things will be added.. Right now its just a proof of concept.
